        Starts the multi-step financial report generation flow.

        **Multi-Step Conversation Flow:**
        1. **Type Selection**: User selects Revenue or Expenses (inline buttons)
        2. **Date Selection**: User selects date preset (inline buttons)
           - this_month, last_month, this_quarter, last_quarter, ytd, this_year
        3. **Format Selection**: User selects PDF, Excel, or CSV (inline buttons)
        4. **Generation**: Report is generated and sent to user

        **Report Formats:**
        - **PDF**: Professional report with bar chart, summary metrics, and invoice table
        - **Excel**: Multi-sheet workbook (Summary + Invoice Details) with RTL support
        - **CSV**: UTF-8 with BOM for Excel Hebrew compatibility

        **Report Metrics:**
        - Total revenue/expenses
        - Invoice count
        - Average per invoice
        - Min/Max amounts
        - Multi-currency breakdown (automatic grouping)
        - Payment method breakdown
        - Revenue trend chart (by month or day depending on date range)

        **Session Management:**
        - Each user can have one active report session at a time
        - Sessions expire after 30 minutes
        - Sessions are validated by chatId + userId + sessionId

        **Rate Limiting:**
        - Enforced during format selection (before report generation)
        - Limit: 3 reports per day per chat
        - Resets daily at midnight

        **Security:**
        - Validates user has access to chat via user-mapping
        - Checks session ownership before processing callbacks
        - Prevents expired session usage
